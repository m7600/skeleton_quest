you=You must be Martigan. Just what is your problem? Why couldn't you leave Krolan alone?
him=Krolan was an employee of mine, and it is extremely sad to see him turned into a dangerous, mindless skeleton.
you=Are you insane? He may be dead, but he's just trying to work like anyone else.
him=Nonsense! Krolan has died! His corpse must be put to rest in peace!
you=And what if he doesn't want that?
him=It doesn't matter what he wants! He's dead! He has to rest in peace! And as a matter of fact, so do you!
