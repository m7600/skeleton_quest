him=And what do we have here? A wandering little skelly, eh?
you=You'll be just like me in a few moments.
him=Is that so? You can discuss it with my guards here. Now if you excuse me, I have a pile of money that I would like to count from the comfort of my stronghold.
you=Good luck surviving there. I poisoned your water supply, creep.
him=So you're the little cretin that has caused that temporary setback, eh?
you=Impressed?
him=You won't make it out of here in one piece. I'll use your skull as a beer mug after I destroy you.
