him=So, you have arrived. The fabled adventuring skeleton.
him=To think that you began your unlife fighting against common thugs. And yet you have carved your own path, slaying every enemy in your wake, all the way to Lionheart's Keep.
you=A fitting name for the lair of an animal. This place looks more like the den of a lion than the keep of a man. You have decorated these walls with the bones of my comrades.
him=I am glad you noticed the exquisite decorations, I like to think that I am a man of refined tastes.
you=How about I decorate these walls with your intestines? Care to have a taste of that?
him=Your choice of words only proves what I already believe: the undead are hostile, dangerous monsters that should be destroyed without mercy.
you=Then let the violence of my words be replaced by the violence of my actions.
